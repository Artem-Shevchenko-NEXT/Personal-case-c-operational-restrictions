## Context

We are designing the restriction form and notification screens for an internal Metro application. The interface must align with the provided Metro documentation for form fields.

The notification screen must clearly and concisly communicate pending actions, so that the users are informed of any missed processes that need to be handeld. 

## Design Principles & Heuristics Applied

* **Brand Identity:** Selected the orange color palette from the internal Metro service website (`metroservice.dk`) rather than the red used on the customer-facing site (`m.dk/da`), to avoid confusion with it being a public aplication.

* **Attachment system:** Added an additional attachment section inside the restriction form, to simplify referencing, and digitize any additional information that applies to a restriction.

* **Nielsen #1 (Visibility of System Status):** Utilized dynamic visual tags, relative timestamps (e.g., "10 min. siden"), clear action buttons like "Underskrive nu", tinted unread notification boxes,  and an unread counter in the top header.


* **Nielsen #4 (Consistency and Standards):** Used standard mobile UI patterns, such as standard icon sets, segmented top tabs, and a bottom navigation bar highlighting the current location.


* **Nielsen #6 (Recognition Rather Than Recall):** Added category icons (Warning for pending Driftsrestriktion signatures, Pen for requested changes, info symbol for System Info) to the left side of each notification card to provide easily digestible information, without requiring heavy reading.


* **Nielsen #7 (Flexibility and Efficiency of Use):** Introduced top filter buttons ("Alle", "Ulæste", "Påkrævet") to allow users to filter items rather than manually scrolling.



## Decision

We will implement the restriction form and notification views using the Metro Service orange color palette, structured with standardized mobile UI components, category icons, and segmented filtering tabs to prioritize and highlight important items.
